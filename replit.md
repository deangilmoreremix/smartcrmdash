# Overview

This is a modern CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application built with React/TypeScript frontend and Node.js/Express backend. The system provides comprehensive contact management, deal tracking, task organization, and AI-powered features for sales and marketing automation. The application uses a monorepo structure with shared schemas and type definitions between client and server.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Design Implementation: Always use the exact design, styling, and structure from attached assets rather than creating custom interpretations. Follow the specific component layouts, color schemes, and UI patterns exactly as provided in the attached asset files.
