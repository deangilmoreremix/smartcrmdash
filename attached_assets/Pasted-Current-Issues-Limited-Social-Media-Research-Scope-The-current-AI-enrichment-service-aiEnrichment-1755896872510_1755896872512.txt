Current Issues:
Limited Social Media Research Scope: The current AI enrichment service (aiEnrichmentService.ts) only searches for basic social profiles (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, website) but doesn't use GPT-5's advanced web research capabilities.

Missing GPT-5 Social Intelligence: The contact AI service (contact-ai.service.ts) doesn't leverage GPT-5's expert-level research abilities for comprehensive social media discovery.

Remote App Integration Gap: The current services don't have proper bridge connections for remote contact apps to access enhanced social media research.

Proposed Solution:
1. Enhanced GPT-5 Social Media Research Service
Create a new gpt5SocialResearchService.ts that:

Uses GPT-5's web browsing and research capabilities
Searches across 15+ social platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, GitHub, Medium, etc.)
Leverages GPT-5's pattern recognition to find social handles based on name/company combinations
Uses multimodal analysis to verify profile authenticity
2. Contact Enrichment Enhancement
Update the existing contact enrichment to:

Call the new GPT-5 social research service
Use GPT-5's reasoning capabilities to validate social media profiles
Extract engagement metrics and professional insights from social profiles
Generate personality insights based on social media activity
3. Remote App Bridge Integration
Create bridge services for remote apps:

remoteSocialResearchBridge.ts - Allows remote contact apps to access GPT-5 social research
remoteEnrichmentBridge.ts - Provides enriched contact data to remote pipeline apps
Universal API endpoints that remote apps can consume
4. Real-time Social Monitoring
