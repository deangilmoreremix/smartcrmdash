# Security Fix Summary

## Critical Security Issue Resolved ✅

### What Was Wrong
API keys with `VITE_` prefix were being bundled into the client-side JavaScript, making them publicly accessible to anyone who visited the site.

### What Was Fixed
1. **Environment Variables** - Removed VITE_ prefix from sensitive API keys
2. **Edge Functions** - Created secure server-side proxies for OpenAI and Gemini APIs
3. **Client Services** - Updated 8 files to use edge functions instead of direct API calls
4. **Type Definitions** - Cleaned up TypeScript definitions to remove sensitive keys
5. **Build Verification** - Confirmed no API keys in production bundle

### Files Modified
```
✅ /.env                                              - Removed VITE_ prefix
✅ /.env.example                                      - Updated with security notes
✅ /supabase/functions/openai-proxy/index.ts         - Created secure proxy
✅ /supabase/functions/gemini-proxy/index.ts         - Created secure proxy
✅ /client/src/services/openaiService.ts             - Use edge function
✅ /client/src/services/geminiService.ts             - Use edge function
✅ /client/src/services/ai-orchestrator.service.ts   - Use edge function
✅ /client/src/services/ai-integration.service.ts    - Use edge function
✅ /client/src/hooks/useSmartAI.ts                   - Updated logging
✅ /client/src/components/ui/AIResearchButton.tsx    - Removed key checks
✅ /client/src/components/dashboard/GPT5FeatureStatus.tsx - Updated messages
✅ /client/src/vite-env.d.ts                         - Removed key types
```

### Verification
```bash
✅ Build successful (1m)
✅ No OpenAI keys in dist/
✅ No Gemini keys in dist/
✅ All AI services use edge functions
✅ TypeScript compilation clean
```

### Security Status
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ API keys in client bundle | ✅ API keys server-side only |
| ❌ Keys visible in DevTools | ✅ Keys never sent to client |
| ❌ Unlimited potential costs | ✅ Rate limiting possible |
| ❌ No usage tracking | ✅ Server-side monitoring |

### Next Steps
1. Deploy edge functions to Supabase
2. Configure API keys in Supabase secrets
3. Test AI features functionality
4. (Optional) Revoke old API keys if exposed
